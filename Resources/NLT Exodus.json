When they heard that the Lord was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":1,"Text":"After this presentation to Israel’s leaders, Moses and Aaron went and spoke to Pharaoh. They told him, “This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says: Let my people go so they may hold a festival in my honor in the wilderness.”"},{"Chapter":5,"Number":2,"Text":"“Is that so?” retorted Pharaoh. “And who is the Lord? Why should I listen to him and let Israel go? I don’t know the Lord, and I will not let Israel go.”"},{"Chapter":5,"Number":3,"Text":"But Aaron and Moses persisted. “The God of the Hebrews has met with us,” they declared. “So let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness so we can offer sacrifices to the Lord our God.

Make the people get it themselves!"},{"Chapter":5,"Number":8,"Text":"But still require them to make the same number of bricks as before. Don’t reduce the quota. They are lazy.

That will teach them to listen to lies!”"},{"Chapter":5,"Number":10,"Text":"So the slave drivers and foremen went out and told the people: “This is what Pharaoh says: I will not provide any more straw for you."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":11,"Text":"Go and get it yourselves.

And you have done nothing to rescue them!”"},{"Chapter":6,"Number":1,"Text":"Then the Lord told Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh. When he feels the force of my strong hand, he will let the people go. In fact, he will force them to leave his land!”"},{"Chapter":6,"Number":2,"Text":"And God said to Moses, “I am Yahweh—‘the Lord.’"},{"Chapter":6,"Number":3,"Text":"I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as El-Shaddai—‘God Almighty’—but I did not reveal my name, Yahweh, to them."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":4,"Text":"And I reaffirmed my covenant with them.
