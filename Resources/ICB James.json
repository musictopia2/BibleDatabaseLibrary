But when these things happen, you should be very happy."},{"Chapter":1,"Number":3,"Text":"You know that these things are testing your faith. And this will give you patience."},{"Chapter":1,"Number":4,"Text":"Let your patience show itself perfectly in what you do. Then you will be perfect and complete. You will have everything you need."},{"Chapter":1,"Number":5,"Text":"But if any of you needs wisdom, you should ask God for it. God is generous. He enjoys giving to all people, so God will give you wisdom."},{"Chapter":1,"Number":6,"Text":"But when you ask God, you must believe. Do not doubt God. Anyone who doubts is like a wave in the sea. The wind blows the wave up and down."},{"Chapter":1,"Number":7,"Text":"He who doubts is thinking two different things at the same time. He cannot decide about anything he does."},{"Chapter":1,"Number":8,"Text":"A person like that should not think that he will receive anything from the Lord. "},{"Chapter":1,"Number":9,"Text":"If a believer is poor, he should take pride that God has made him spiritually rich."},{"Chapter":1,"Number":10,"Text":"If he is rich, he should take pride that God has shown him that he is spiritually poor. The rich person will die like a wild flower in the grass."},{"Chapter":1,"Number":11,"Text":"The sun rises and becomes hotter and hotter. The heat makes the plants very dry, and the flower falls off. The flower was beautiful, but now it is dead. It is the same with a rich person. While he is still taking care of his business, he will die. "},{"Chapter":1,"Number":12,"Text":"When a person is tempted and still continues strong, he should be happy. After he has proved his faith, God will reward him with life forever. God promised this to all people who love him."},{"Chapter":1,"Number":13,"Text":"When someone is being tempted, he should not say, “God is tempting me.” Evil cannot tempt God, and God himself does not tempt anyone."},{"Chapter":1,"Number":14,"Text":"It is the evil that a person wants that tempts him.

Don’t be proud but accept God’s teaching that is planted in your hearts. This teaching can save your souls."},{"Chapter":1,"Number":22,"Text":"Do what God’s teaching says; do not just listen and do nothing. When you only sit and listen, you are fooling yourselves."},{"Chapter":1,"Number":23,"Text":"A person who hears God’s teaching and does nothing is like a man looking in a mirror."},{"Chapter":1,"Number":24,"Text":"He sees his face, then goes away and quickly forgets what he looked like."},{"Chapter":1,"Number":25,"Text":"But the truly happy person is the one who carefully studies God’s perfect law that makes people free.

You say, “Please, sit here in this good seat.” But you say to the poor man, “Stand over there,” or “Sit on the floor by my feet!”"},{"Chapter":2,"Number":4,"Text":"What are you doing? You are making some people more important than others. With evil thoughts you are deciding which person is better."},{"Chapter":2,"Number":5,"Text":"Listen, my dear brothers! God chose the poor in the world to be rich with faith. He chose them to receive the kingdom God promised to people who love him."},{"Chapter":2,"Number":6,"Text":"But you show no respect to the poor man. And you know that it is the rich who are always trying to control your lives. And they are the ones who take you to court."},{"Chapter":2,"Number":7,"Text":"They are the ones who say bad things against Jesus, who owns you."},{"Chapter":2,"Number":8,"Text":"One law rules over all other laws. This royal law is found in the Scriptures: “Love your neighbor as you love yourself.” If you obey this law, then you are doing right."},{"Chapter":2,"Number":9,"Text":"But if you are treating one person as if he were more important than another, then you are sinning.

I hope you stay warm and get plenty to eat.” You say this, but you do not give that person the things he needs.

He cannot be made right by faith only."},{"Chapter":2,"Number":25,"Text":"Another example is Rahab, who was a prostitute. But she was made right with God by something she did: She helped the spies for God’s people. She welcomed them into her home and helped them escape by a different road."},{"Chapter":2,"Number":26,"Text":"A person’s body that does not have a spirit is dead. It is the same with faith. Faith that does nothing is dead!"},{"Chapter":3,"Number":1,"Text":"My brothers, not many of you should become teachers.

He would be able to control his whole body, too."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":3,"Text":"We put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us. We can control their whole bodies."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":4,"Text":"It is the same with ships. A ship is very big, and it is pushed by strong winds. But a very small rudder controls that big ship. The man who controls the rudder decides where the ship will go. The ship goes where the man wants."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":5,"Text":"It is the same with the tongue. It is a small part of the body, but it brags about doing great things.A big forest fire can be started with only a little flame."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":6,"Text":"And the tongue is like a fire.

They come from the selfish desires that make war inside you."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":2,"Text":"You want things, but you do not have them. So you are ready to kill and are jealous of other people. But you still cannot get what you want. So you argue and fight. You do not get what you want because you do not ask God."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":3,"Text":"Or when you ask, you do not receive because the reason you ask is wrong. You want things only so that you can use them for your own pleasures."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":4,"Text":"So, you people are not loyal to God! You should know that loving the world is the same as hating God. So if a person wants to be a friend of the world, he makes himself God’s enemy."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":5,"Text":"Do you think the Scripture means nothing? It says, “The Spirit that God made to live in us wants us for himself alone.”"},{"Chapter":4,"Number":6,"Text":"But God gives us even more grace, as the Scripture says,“God is against the proud,    but he gives grace to the humble.”"},{"Chapter":4,"Number":7,"Text":"So give yourselves to God.
