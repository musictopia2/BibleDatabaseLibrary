Should I come with a rod to punish you, or should I come with love and a gentle spirit?"},{"Chapter":5,"Number":1,"Text":"I can hardly believe the report about the sexual immorality going on among you—something that even pagans don’t do.

And the man who was uncircumcised when he became a believer should not be circumcised now."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":19,"Text":"For it makes no difference whether or not a man has been circumcised. The important thing is to keep God’s commandments."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":20,"Text":"Yes, each of you should remain as you were when God called you."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":21,"Text":"Are you a slave? Don’t let that worry you—but if you get a chance to be free, take it."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":22,"Text":"And remember, if you were a slave when the Lord called you, you are now free in the Lord.

If you do not have a wife, do not seek to get married."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":28,"Text":"But if you do get married, it is not a sin. And if a young woman gets married, it is not a sin. However, those who get married at this time will have troubles, and I am trying to spare you those problems."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":29,"Text":"But let me say this, dear brothers and sisters: The time that remains is very short.

For this world as we know it will soon pass away."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":32,"Text":"I want you to be free from the concerns of this life. An unmarried man can spend his time doing the Lord’s work and thinking how to please him."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":33,"Text":"But a married man has to think about his earthly responsibilities and how to please his wife."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":34,"Text":"His interests are divided. In the same way, a woman who is no longer married or has never been married can be devoted to the Lord and holy in body and in spirit. But a married woman has to think about her earthly responsibilities and how to please her husband."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":35,"Text":"I am saying this for your benefit, not to place restrictions on you. I want you to do whatever will help you serve the Lord best, with as few distractions as possible."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":36,"Text":"But if a man thinks that he’s treating his fiancée improperly and will inevitably give in to his passion, let him marry her as he wishes. It is not a sin."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":37,"Text":"But if he has decided firmly not to marry and there is no urgency and he can control his passion, he does well not to marry."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":38,"Text":"So the person who marries his fiancée does well, and the person who doesn’t marry does even better."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":39,"Text":"A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. If her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but only if he loves the Lord."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":40,"Text":"But in my opinion it would be better for her to stay single, and I think I am giving you counsel from God’s Spirit when I say this."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":1,"Text":"Now regarding your question about food that has been offered to idols.
