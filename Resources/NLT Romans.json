He did this through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty for our sins."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":25,"Text":"For God presented Jesus as the sacrifice for sin. People are made right with God when they believe that Jesus sacrificed his life, shedding his blood. This sacrifice shows that God was being fair when he held back and did not punish those who sinned in times past,"},{"Chapter":3,"Number":26,"Text":"for he was looking ahead and including them in what he would do in this present time. God did this to demonstrate his righteousness, for he himself is fair and just, and he makes sinners right in his sight when they believe in Jesus."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":27,"Text":"Can we boast, then, that we have done anything to be accepted by God? No, because our acquittal is not based on obeying the law. It is based on faith."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":28,"Text":"So we are made right with God through faith and not by obeying the law."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":29,"Text":"After all, is God the God of the Jews only? Isn’t he also the God of the Gentiles? Of course he is."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":30,"Text":"There is only one God, and he makes people right with himself only by faith, whether they are Jews or Gentiles."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":31,"Text":"Well then, if we emphasize faith, does this mean that we can forget about the law? Of course not! In fact, only when we have faith do we truly fulfill the law."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":1,"Text":"Abraham was, humanly speaking, the founder of our Jewish nation. What did he discover about being made right with God?"},{"Chapter":4,"Number":2,"Text":"If his good deeds had made him acceptable to God, he would have had something to boast about. But that was not God’s way."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":3,"Text":"For the Scriptures tell us, “Abraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith.”"},{"Chapter":4,"Number":4,"Text":"When people work, their wages are not a gift, but something they have earned."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":5,"Text":"But people are counted as righteous, not because of their work, but because of their faith in God who forgives sinners."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":6,"Text":"David also spoke of this when he described the happiness of those who are declared righteous without working for it:"},{"Chapter":4,"Number":7,"Text":"“Oh, what joy for those    whose disobedience is forgiven,    whose sins are put out of sight."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":8,"Text":"Yes, what joy for those    whose record the Lord has cleared of sin.”"},{"Chapter":4,"Number":9,"Text":"Now, is this blessing only for the Jews, or is it also for uncircumcised Gentiles? Well, we have been saying that Abraham was counted as righteous by God because of his faith."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":10,"Text":"But how did this happen? Was he counted as righteous only after he was circumcised, or was it before he was circumcised? Clearly, God accepted Abraham before he was circumcised!"},{"Chapter":4,"Number":11,"Text":"Circumcision was a sign that Abraham already had faith and that God had already accepted him and declared him to be righteous—even before he was circumcised. So Abraham is the spiritual father of those who have faith but have not been circumcised. They are counted as righteous because of their faith."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":12,"Text":"And Abraham is also the spiritual father of those who have been circumcised, but only if they have the same kind of faith Abraham had before he was circumcised."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":13,"Text":"Clearly, God’s promise to give the whole earth to Abraham and his descendants was based not on his obedience to God’s law, but on a right relationship with God that comes by faith."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":14,"Text":"If God’s promise is only for those who obey the law, then faith is not necessary and the promise is pointless."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":15,"Text":"For the law always brings punishment on those who try to obey it. (The only way to avoid breaking the law is to have no law to break!)"},{"Chapter":4,"Number":16,"Text":"So the promise is received by faith. It is given as a free gift. And we are all certain to receive it, whether or not we live according to the law of Moses, if we have faith like Abraham’s. For Abraham is the father of all who believe."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":17,"Text":"That is what the Scriptures mean when God told him, “I have made you the father of many nations.” This happened because Abraham believed in the God who brings the dead back to life and who creates new things out of nothing."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":18,"Text":"Even when there was no reason for hope, Abraham kept hoping—believing that he would become the father of many nations. For God had said to him, “That’s how many descendants you will have!”"},{"Chapter":4,"Number":19,"Text":"And Abraham’s faith did not weaken, even though, at about 100 years of age, he figured his body was as good as dead—and so was Sarah’s womb."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":20,"Text":"Abraham never wavered in believing God’s promise. In fact, his faith grew stronger, and in this he brought glory to God."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":21,"Text":"He was fully convinced that God is able to do whatever he promises."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":22,"Text":"And because of Abraham’s faith, God counted him as righteous."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":23,"Text":"And when God counted him as righteous, it wasn’t just for Abraham’s benefit. It was recorded"},{"Chapter":4,"Number":24,"Text":"for our benefit, too, assuring us that God will also count us as righteous if we believe in him, the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":25,"Text":"He was handed over to die because of our sins, and he was raised to life to make us right with God."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":1,"Text":"Therefore, since we have been made right in God’s sight by faith, we have peace with God because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done for us."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":2,"Text":"Because of our faith, Christ has brought us into this place of undeserved privilege where we now stand, and we confidently and joyfully look forward to sharing God’s glory."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":3,"Text":"We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they help us develop endurance."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":4,"Text":"And endurance develops strength of character, and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":5,"Text":"And this hope will not lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":6,"Text":"When we were utterly helpless, Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":7,"Text":"Now, most people would not be willing to die for an upright person, though someone might perhaps be willing to die for a person who is especially good."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":8,"Text":"But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":9,"Text":"And since we have been made right in God’s sight by the blood of Christ, he will certainly save us from God’s condemnation."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":10,"Text":"For since our friendship with God was restored by the death of his Son while we were still his enemies, we will certainly be saved through the life of his Son."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":11,"Text":"So now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with God because our Lord Jesus Christ has made us friends of God. "},{"Chapter":5,"Number":12,"Text":"When Adam sinned, sin entered the world. Adam’s sin brought death, so death spread to everyone, for everyone sinned."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":13,"Text":"Yes, people sinned even before the law was given. But it was not counted as sin because there was not yet any law to break."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":14,"Text":"Still, everyone died—from the time of Adam to the time of Moses—even those who did not disobey an explicit commandment of God, as Adam did. Now Adam is a symbol, a representation of Christ, who was yet to come."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":15,"Text":"But there is a great difference between Adam’s sin and God’s gracious gift. For the sin of this one man, Adam, brought death to many. But even greater is God’s wonderful grace and his gift of forgiveness to many through this other man, Jesus Christ."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":16,"Text":"And the result of God’s gracious gift is very different from the result of that one man’s sin. For Adam’s sin led to condemnation, but God’s free gift leads to our being made right with God, even though we are guilty of many sins."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":17,"Text":"For the sin of this one man, Adam, caused death to rule over many. But even greater is God’s wonderful grace and his gift of righteousness, for all who receive it will live in triumph over sin and death through this one man, Jesus Christ."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":18,"Text":"Yes, Adam’s one sin brings condemnation for everyone, but Christ’s one act of righteousness brings a right relationship with God and new life for everyone."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":19,"Text":"Because one person disobeyed God, many became sinners. But because one other person obeyed God, many will be made righteous."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":20,"Text":"God’s law was given so that all people could see how sinful they were. But as people sinned more and more, God’s wonderful grace became more abundant."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":21,"Text":"So just as sin ruled over all people and brought them to death, now God’s wonderful grace rules instead, giving us right standing with God and resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":1,"Text":"Well then, should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his wonderful grace?"},{"Chapter":6,"Number":2,"Text":"Of course not! Since we have died to sin, how can we continue to live in it?"},{"Chapter":6,"Number":3,"Text":"Or have you forgotten that when we were joined with Christ Jesus in baptism, we joined him in his death?"},{"Chapter":6,"Number":4,"Text":"For we died and were buried with Christ by baptism. And just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious power of the Father, now we also may live new lives."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":5,"Text":"Since we have been united with him in his death, we will also be raised to life as he was."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":6,"Text":"We know that our old sinful selves were crucified with Christ so that sin might lose its power in our lives. We are no longer slaves to sin."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":7,"Text":"For when we died with Christ we were set free from the power of sin."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":8,"Text":"And since we died with Christ, we know we will also live with him."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":9,"Text":"We are sure of this because Christ was raised from the dead, and he will never die again. Death no longer has any power over him."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":10,"Text":"When he died, he died once to break the power of sin. But now that he lives, he lives for the glory of God."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":11,"Text":"So you also should consider yourselves to be dead to the power of sin and alive to God through Christ Jesus."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":12,"Text":"Do not let sin control the way you live; do not give in to sinful desires."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":13,"Text":"Do not let any part of your body become an instrument of evil to serve sin. Instead, give yourselves completely to God, for you were dead, but now you have new life. So use your whole body as an instrument to do what is right for the glory of God."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":14,"Text":"Sin is no longer your master, for you no longer live under the requirements of the law. Instead, you live under the freedom of God’s grace."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":15,"Text":"Well then, since God’s grace has set us free from the law, does that mean we can go on sinning? Of course not!"},{"Chapter":6,"Number":16,"Text":"Don’t you realize that you become the slave of whatever you choose to obey? You can be a slave to sin, which leads to death, or you can choose to obey God, which leads to righteous living."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":17,"Text":"Thank God! Once you were slaves of sin, but now you wholeheartedly obey this teaching we have given you."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":18,"Text":"Now you are free from your slavery to sin, and you have become slaves to righteous living."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":19,"Text":"Because of the weakness of your human nature, I am using the illustration of slavery to help you understand all this. Previously, you let yourselves be slaves to impurity and lawlessness, which led ever deeper into sin. Now you must give yourselves to be slaves to righteous living so that you will become holy."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":20,"Text":"When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the obligation to do right."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":21,"Text":"And what was the result? You are now ashamed of the things you used to do, things that end in eternal doom."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":22,"Text":"But now you are free from the power of sin and have become slaves of God. Now you do those things that lead to holiness and result in eternal life."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":23,"Text":"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":1,"Text":"Now, dear brothers and sisters—you who are familiar with the law—don’t you know that the law applies only while a person is living?"},{"Chapter":7,"Number":2,"Text":"For example, when a woman marries, the law binds her to her husband as long as he is alive. But if he dies, the laws of marriage no longer apply to her."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":3,"Text":"So while her husband is alive, she would be committing adultery if she married another man. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law and does not commit adultery when she remarries."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":4,"Text":"So, my dear brothers and sisters, this is the point: You died to the power of the law when you died with Christ. And now you are united with the one who was raised from the dead. As a result, we can produce a harvest of good deeds for God."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":5,"Text":"When we were controlled by our old nature, sinful desires were at work within us, and the law aroused these evil desires that produced a harvest of sinful deeds, resulting in death."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":6,"Text":"But now we have been released from the law, for we died to it and are no longer captive to its power. Now we can serve God, not in the old way of obeying the letter of the law, but in the new way of living in the Spirit. "},{"Chapter":7,"Number":7,"Text":"Well then, am I suggesting that the law of God is sinful? Of course not! In fact, it was the law that showed me my sin. I would never have known that coveting is wrong if the law had not said, “You must not covet.”"},{"Chapter":7,"Number":8,"Text":"But sin used this command to arouse all kinds of covetous desires within me!
