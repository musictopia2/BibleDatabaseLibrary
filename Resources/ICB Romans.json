Did God accept Abraham before or after he was circumcised? God accepted him before his circumcision."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":11,"Text":"Abraham was circumcised later to show that God accepted him. His circumcision was proof that he was right with God through faith before he was circumcised. So Abraham is the father of all those who believe but are not circumcised.

He received it because he was right with God through his faith."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":14,"Text":"If people could receive what God promised by following the law, then faith is worthless. And God’s promise to Abraham is worthless,"},{"Chapter":4,"Number":15,"Text":"because the law can only bring God’s anger. But if there is no law, then there is nothing to disobey."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":16,"Text":"So people receive God’s promise by having faith. This happens so that the promise can be a free gift. And if the promise is a free gift, then all of Abraham’s children can have that promise. The promise is not only for those people that live under the law of Moses. It is for anyone who lives with faith like Abraham. He is the father of us all."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":17,"Text":"As it is written in the Scriptures: “I am making you a father of many nations.” This is true before God.

As God told him, “Your descendants will also be too many to count.”"},{"Chapter":4,"Number":19,"Text":"Abraham was almost 100 years old, much past the age for having children. Also, Sarah could not have children. Abraham thought about all this. But his faith in God did not become weak."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":20,"Text":"He never doubted that God would keep his promise. Abraham never stopped believing. He grew stronger in his faith and gave praise to God."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":21,"Text":"Abraham felt sure that God was able to do the thing that God promised."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":22,"Text":"So, “God accepted Abraham’s faith, and that made him right with God.”"},{"Chapter":4,"Number":23,"Text":"Those words (“God accepted Abraham’s faith”) were written not only for Abraham."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":24,"Text":"They were written also for us.

God gave us his love through the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to us."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":6,"Text":"Christ died for us while we were still weak. We were living against God, but at the right time, Christ died for us."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":7,"Text":"Very few people will die to save the life of someone else.

Through Jesus we are now God’s friends again. "},{"Chapter":5,"Number":12,"Text":"Sin came into the world because of what one man did. And with sin came death. And this is why all men must die—because all men sinned."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":13,"Text":"Sin was in the world before the law of Moses. But God does not judge people guilty of sin if there is no law."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":14,"Text":"But from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, everyone had to die. Adam died because he sinned by not obeying God’s command. But even those who did not sin in the same way had to die.Adam was like the One who was coming in the future."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":15,"Text":"But God’s free gift is not like Adam’s sin. Many people died because of the sin of that one man. But the grace that they received from God was much greater. Many people received God’s gift of life by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":16,"Text":"After Adam sinned once, he was judged guilty. But the gift of God is different. God’s free gift came after many sins. And the gift makes people right with God."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":17,"Text":"One man sinned, and so death ruled all people because of that one man. But now some people accept God’s full grace and the great gift of being made right with him. They will surely have true life and rule through the one man, Jesus Christ."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":18,"Text":"So one sin of Adam brought the punishment of death to all people. But in the same way, one good act that Christ did makes all people right with God. And that brings true life for all."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":19,"Text":"One man disobeyed God, and many became sinners. But in the same way, one man obeyed God, and many will be made right."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":20,"Text":"The law came to make people have more sin. But when people had more sin, God gave them more of his grace."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":21,"Text":"Sin once used death to rule us. But God gave people more of his grace so that grace could rule by making people right with him. And this brings life forever through Jesus Christ our Lord."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":1,"Text":"So do you think that we should continue sinning so that God will give us more and more grace?"},{"Chapter":6,"Number":2,"Text":"No! We died to our old sinful lives. So how can we continue living with sin?"},{"Chapter":6,"Number":3,"Text":"Did you forget that all of us became part of Christ when we were baptized? We shared his death in our baptism."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":4,"Text":"So when we were baptized, we were buried with Christ and shared his death. We were buried with him so that we could live a new life, just as Christ was raised from death by the wonderful power of the Father."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":5,"Text":"Christ died, and we have been joined with Christ by dying too. So we will also be joined with him by rising from death as he did."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":6,"Text":"We know that our old life died with Christ on the cross. This was so that our sinful selves would have no power over us, and we would not be slaves to sin."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":7,"Text":"Anyone who has died is made free from sin’s control."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":8,"Text":"If we died with Christ, we know that we will also live with him."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":9,"Text":"Christ was raised from death.

"},{"Chapter":6,"Number":15,"Text":"So what should we do? Should we sin because we are under grace and not under law? No!"},{"Chapter":6,"Number":16,"Text":"Surely you know that when you give yourselves like slaves to obey someone, then you are really slaves of that person. The person you obey is your master. You can follow sin, or obey God. Sin brings spiritual death. But obeying God makes you right with him."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":17,"Text":"In the past you were slaves to sin—sin controlled you. But thank God, you fully obeyed the things that were taught to you."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":18,"Text":"You were made free from sin, and now you are slaves to goodness."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":19,"Text":"I use this example because this is hard for you to understand. In the past you offered the parts of your body to be slaves to sin and evil. You lived only for evil. In the same way now you must give yourselves to be slaves of goodness.

But if her husband dies, then she is free from the law of marriage."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":3,"Text":"But if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, the law says she is guilty of adultery. But if her husband dies, then the woman is free from the law of marriage. So if she marries another man after her husband dies, she is not guilty of adultery."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":4,"Text":"In the same way, my brothers, your old selves died, and you became free from the law through the body of Christ.
