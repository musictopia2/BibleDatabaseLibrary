The purpose of all these things should be to help the church grow strong."},{"Chapter":14,"Number":27,"Text":"When you meet together, if anyone speaks in a different language, then it should be only two, or not more than three, who speak. They should speak one after the other. And someone should interpret what they say."},{"Chapter":14,"Number":28,"Text":"But if there is no interpreter, then anyone who speaks in a different language should be quiet in the church meeting.
