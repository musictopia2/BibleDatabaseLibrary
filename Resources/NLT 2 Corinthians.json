God’s power is working in us. We use the weapons of righteousness in the right hand for attack and the left hand for defense."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":8,"Text":"We serve God whether people honor us or despise us, whether they slander us or praise us. We are honest, but they call us impostors."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":9,"Text":"We are ignored, even though we are well known. We live close to death, but we are still alive. We have been beaten, but we have not been killed."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":10,"Text":"Our hearts ache, but we always have joy. We are poor, but we give spiritual riches to others. We own nothing, and yet we have everything."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":11,"Text":"Oh, dear Corinthian friends! We have spoken honestly with you, and our hearts are open to you."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":12,"Text":"There is no lack of love on our part, but you have withheld your love from us."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":13,"Text":"I am asking you to respond as if you were my own children. Open your hearts to us! "},{"Chapter":6,"Number":14,"Text":"Don’t team up with those who are unbelievers. How can righteousness be a partner with wickedness? How can light live with darkness?"},{"Chapter":6,"Number":15,"Text":"What harmony can there be between Christ and the devil? How can a believer be a partner with an unbeliever?"},{"Chapter":6,"Number":16,"Text":"And what union can there be between God’s temple and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God said:“I will live in them    and walk among them.I will be their God,    and they will be my people."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":17,"Text":"Therefore, come out from among unbelievers,    and separate yourselves from them, says the Lord.Don’t touch their filthy things,    and I will welcome you."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":18,"Text":"And I will be your Father,    and you will be my sons and daughters,    says the Lord Almighty.”"},{"Chapter":7,"Number":1,"Text":"Because we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that can defile our body or spirit.

It was the kind of sorrow God wants his people to have, so you were not harmed by us in any way."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":10,"Text":"For the kind of sorrow God wants us to experience leads us away from sin and results in salvation. There’s no regret for that kind of sorrow. But worldly sorrow, which lacks repentance, results in spiritual death."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":11,"Text":"Just see what this godly sorrow produced in you! Such earnestness, such concern to clear yourselves, such indignation, such alarm, such longing to see me, such zeal, and such a readiness to punish wrong. You showed that you have done everything necessary to make things right."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":12,"Text":"My purpose, then, was not to write about who did the wrong or who was wronged.

But they are also filled with abundant joy, which has overflowed in rich generosity."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":3,"Text":"For I can testify that they gave not only what they could afford, but far more. And they did it of their own free will."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":4,"Text":"They begged us again and again for the privilege of sharing in the gift for the believers in Jerusalem."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":5,"Text":"They even did more than we had hoped, for their first action was to give themselves to the Lord and to us, just as God wanted them to do."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":6,"Text":"So we have urged Titus, who encouraged your giving in the first place, to return to you and encourage you to finish this ministry of giving."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":7,"Text":"Since you excel in so many ways—in your faith, your gifted speakers, your knowledge, your enthusiasm, and your love from us—I want you to excel also in this gracious act of giving."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":8,"Text":"I am not commanding you to do this.

In fact, it was your enthusiasm that stirred up many of the Macedonian believers to begin giving."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":3,"Text":"But I am sending these brothers to be sure you really are ready, as I have been telling them, and that your money is all collected. I don’t want to be wrong in my boasting about you."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":4,"Text":"We would be embarrassed—not to mention your own embarrassment—if some Macedonian believers came with me and found that you weren’t ready after all I had told them!"},{"Chapter":9,"Number":5,"Text":"So I thought I should send these brothers ahead of me to make sure the gift you promised is ready.
