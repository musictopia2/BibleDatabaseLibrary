When this is done, you can go on your merry way to the banquet with the king.” This pleased Haman, and he ordered the pole set up."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":1,"Text":"That night the king had trouble sleeping, so he ordered an attendant to bring the book of the history of his reign so it could be read to him."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":2,"Text":"In those records he discovered an account of how Mordecai had exposed the plot of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the eunuchs who guarded the door to the king’s private quarters.

As it happened, Haman had just arrived in the outer court of the palace to ask the king to impale Mordecai on the pole he had prepared."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":5,"Text":"So the attendants replied to the king, “Haman is out in the court.”“Bring him in,” the king ordered."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":6,"Text":"So Haman came in, and the king said, “What should I do to honor a man who truly pleases me?”Haman thought to himself, “Whom would the king wish to honor more than me?”"},{"Chapter":6,"Number":7,"Text":"So he replied, “If the king wishes to honor someone,"},{"Chapter":6,"Number":8,"Text":"he should bring out one of the king’s own royal robes, as well as a horse that the king himself has ridden—one with a royal emblem on its head."},{"Chapter":6,"Number":9,"Text":"Let the robes and the horse be handed over to one of the king’s most noble officials. And let him see that the man whom the king wishes to honor is dressed in the king’s robes and led through the city square on the king’s horse.

Take the robes and my horse, and do just as you have said for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the gate of the palace.

It will be fatal to continue opposing him.”"},{"Chapter":6,"Number":14,"Text":"While they were still talking, the king’s eunuchs arrived and quickly took Haman to the banquet Esther had prepared."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":1,"Text":"So the king and Haman went to Queen Esther’s banquet."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":2,"Text":"On this second occasion, while they were drinking wine, the king again said to Esther, “Tell me what you want, Queen Esther. What is your request? I will give it to you, even if it is half the kingdom!”"},{"Chapter":7,"Number":3,"Text":"Queen Esther replied, “If I have found favor with the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my request, I ask that my life and the lives of my people will be spared."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":4,"Text":"For my people and I have been sold to those who would kill, slaughter, and annihilate us. If we had merely been sold as slaves, I could remain quiet, for that would be too trivial a matter to warrant disturbing the king.”"},{"Chapter":7,"Number":5,"Text":"“Who would do such a thing?” King Xerxes demanded. “Who would be so presumptuous as to touch you?”"},{"Chapter":7,"Number":6,"Text":"Esther replied, “This wicked Haman is our adversary and our enemy.” Haman grew pale with fright before the king and queen."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":7,"Text":"Then the king jumped to his feet in a rage and went out into the palace garden.Haman, however, stayed behind to plead for his life with Queen Esther, for he knew that the king intended to kill him."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":8,"Text":"In despair he fell on the couch where Queen Esther was reclining, just as the king was returning from the palace garden.The king exclaimed, “Will he even assault the queen right here in the palace, before my very eyes?” And as soon as the king spoke, his attendants covered Haman’s face, signaling his doom."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":9,"Text":"Then Harbona, one of the king’s eunuchs, said, “Haman has set up a sharpened pole that stands seventy-five feet tall in his own courtyard. He intended to use it to impale Mordecai, the man who saved the king from assassination.”“Then impale Haman on it!” the king ordered."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":10,"Text":"So they impaled Haman on the pole he had set up for Mordecai, and the king’s anger subsided."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":1,"Text":"On that same day King Xerxes gave the property of Haman, the enemy of the Jews, to Queen Esther. Then Mordecai was brought before the king, for Esther had told the king how they were related."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":2,"Text":"The king took off his signet ring—which he had taken back from Haman—and gave it to Mordecai.

So she rose and stood before him."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":5,"Text":"Esther said, “If it please the king, and if I have found favor with him, and if he thinks it is right, and if I am pleasing to him, let there be a decree that reverses the orders of Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, who ordered that Jews throughout all the king’s provinces should be destroyed."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":6,"Text":"For how can I endure to see my people and my family slaughtered and destroyed?”"},{"Chapter":8,"Number":7,"Text":"Then King Xerxes said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, “I have given Esther the property of Haman, and he has been impaled on a pole because he tried to destroy the Jews."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":8,"Text":"Now go ahead and send a message to the Jews in the king’s name, telling them whatever you want, and seal it with the king’s signet ring.

The decree was written in the scripts and languages of all the peoples of the empire, including that of the Jews."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":10,"Text":"The decree was written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with the king’s signet ring.
