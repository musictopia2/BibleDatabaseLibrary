There is no difference between slaves and free men. There is no difference between male and female. You are all the same in Christ Jesus."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":29,"Text":"You belong to Christ. So you are Abraham’s descendants. You get all of God’s blessings because of the promise that God made to Abraham."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":1,"Text":"I want to tell you this: While the one who will inherit his father’s property is still a child, he is no different from a slave. It does not matter that the child owns everything."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":2,"Text":"While he is a child, he must obey those who are chosen to care for him.

The mother of the other son was a free woman."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":23,"Text":"Abraham’s son from the slave woman was born in the normal human way. But the son from the free woman was born because of the promise God made to Abraham."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":24,"Text":"This makes a picture for us. The two women are like the two agreements between God and men. One agreement is the law that God made on Mount Sinai. The people who are under this agreement are like slaves. The mother named Hagar is like that agreement."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":25,"Text":"She is like Mount Sinai in Arabia and is a picture of the earthly Jewish city of Jerusalem. This city is a slave, and all its people are slaves to the law."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":26,"Text":"But the heavenly Jerusalem which is above is like the free woman. She is our mother."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":27,"Text":"It is written in the Scriptures:“Be happy, Jerusalem.    You are like a woman who never gave birth to children.Start singing and shout for joy.    You never felt the pain of giving birth to children.But you will have more children    than the woman who has a husband.”"},{"Chapter":4,"Number":28,"Text":"My brothers, you are God’s children because of his promise, as Isaac was then."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":29,"Text":"The son who was born in the normal way treated the other son badly.

We are children of the free woman."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":1,"Text":"We have freedom now because Christ made us free. So stand strong. Do not change and go back into the slavery of the law."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":2,"Text":"Listen! I am Paul.

Then you will not do what your sinful selves want."},{"Chapter":5,"Number":17,"Text":"Our sinful selves want what is against the Spirit. The Spirit wants what is against our sinful selves. The two are against each other.
