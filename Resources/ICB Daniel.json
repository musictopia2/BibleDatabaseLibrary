These men were not to have anything wrong with their bodies. They were to be handsome and well educated. They were to be able to learn and understand things.

Ashpenaz was to teach them the language and writings of the Babylonians."},{"Chapter":1,"Number":5,"Text":"The king gave the young men a certain amount of food and wine every day. That was the same kind of food that the king ate. They were to be trained for three years.

These were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah."},{"Chapter":1,"Number":7,"Text":"Then Ashpenaz, the chief officer, gave them Babylonian names. Daniel’s new name was Belteshazzar. Hananiah’s was Shadrach. Mishael’s was Meshach. And Azariah’s new name was Abednego."},{"Chapter":1,"Number":8,"Text":"Daniel decided not to eat the king’s food and wine because that would make him unclean.

But that kingdom will not be as great as yours. Next a third kingdom will rule over the earth. That is the bronze part."},{"Chapter":2,"Number":40,"Text":"Then there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron. Iron crushes and smashes things to pieces. In the same way the fourth kingdom will smash and crush all the other kingdoms."},{"Chapter":2,"Number":41,"Text":"“You saw that the statue’s feet and toes were partly baked clay and partly iron. That means the fourth kingdom will be a divided kingdom. It will have some of the strength of iron in it. As you saw, iron was mixed with clay."},{"Chapter":2,"Number":42,"Text":"The toes of the statue were partly iron and partly clay. So the fourth kingdom will be partly strong like iron and partly breakable like clay."},{"Chapter":2,"Number":43,"Text":"You saw the iron mixed with clay. But iron and clay don’t mix completely together. In the same way the people of the fourth kingdom will be a mixture. Those people will not be united as one people."},{"Chapter":2,"Number":44,"Text":"“During the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up another kingdom. It will never be destroyed. And it will not be given to another group of people. This kingdom will crush all the other kingdoms. It will bring them to an end.

You were able to tell these secret things to me.”"},{"Chapter":2,"Number":48,"Text":"Then the king gave Daniel an important position in his kingdom. And he gave many gifts to Daniel. Nebuchadnezzar made him ruler over the whole area of Babylon. And he put Daniel in charge of all the wise men of Babylon."},{"Chapter":2,"Number":49,"Text":"Daniel asked the king to make Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego important leaders over the area of Babylon. And the king did as Daniel asked. Daniel himself became one of the important people who stayed at the royal court."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":1,"Text":"Now King Nebuchadnezzar had a gold statue made. That statue was 90 feet high and 9 feet wide. He set up the statue on the plain of Dura in the area of Babylon."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":2,"Text":"Then the king called the important leaders: the governors, assistant governors, captains of the soldiers, people who advised the king, keepers of the treasury, judges, rulers and all other officers in his kingdom. He wanted these men to come to the special service for the statue he had set up."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":3,"Text":"So they all came for the special service. And they stood in front of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":4,"Text":"Then the man who made announcements for the king spoke in a loud voice.

So they bowed down and worshiped the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":8,"Text":"Then some Babylonians came up to the king. They began speaking against the men of Judah."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":9,"Text":"They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “Our king, live forever!"},{"Chapter":3,"Number":10,"Text":"Our king, you gave a command. You said that everyone would hear the horns, lyres, zithers, harps, pipes and all the other musical instruments. Then they would have to bow down and worship the gold statue."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":11,"Text":"Anyone who wouldn’t do this was to be thrown into a blazing furnace."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":12,"Text":"Our king, there are some men of Judah who did not pay attention to your order. You made them important officers in the area of Babylon. Their names are Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. They do not serve your gods. And they do not worship the gold statue you have set up.”"},{"Chapter":3,"Number":13,"Text":"Nebuchadnezzar became very angry. He called for Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. So those men were brought to the king."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":14,"Text":"And Nebuchadnezzar said, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, is it true that you do not serve my gods? And is it true that you did not worship the gold statue I have set up?"},{"Chapter":3,"Number":15,"Text":"Now, you will hear the sound of the horns, flutes, lyres, zithers, harps, pipes and all the other musical instruments. And you must be ready to bow down and worship the statue I made. That will be good. But if you do not worship it, you will be thrown quickly into the blazing furnace. Then no god will be able to save you from my power!”"},{"Chapter":3,"Number":16,"Text":"Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego answered the king. They said, “Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves to you."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":17,"Text":"You can throw us into the blazing furnace. The God we serve is able to save us from the furnace and your power. If he does this, it is good."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":18,"Text":"But even if God does not save us, we want you, our king, to know this: We will not serve your gods. We will not worship the gold statue you have set up.”"},{"Chapter":3,"Number":19,"Text":"Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. He ordered the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than usual."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":20,"Text":"Then he commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. The king told the soldiers to throw them into the blazing furnace."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":21,"Text":"So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were tied up and thrown into the blazing furnace. They were still wearing their robes, trousers, turbans and other clothes."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":22,"Text":"The king was very angry when he gave the command. And the furnace was made very hot. The fire was so hot that the flames killed the strong soldiers who took Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego there."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":23,"Text":"Firmly tied, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego fell into the blazing furnace."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":24,"Text":"Then King Nebuchadnezzar was very surprised and jumped to his feet. He asked the men who advised him, “Didn’t we tie up only three men? Didn’t we throw them into the fire?”They answered, “Yes, our king.”"},{"Chapter":3,"Number":25,"Text":"The king said, “Look! I see four men. They are walking around in the fire. They are not tied up, and they are not burned. The fourth man looks like a son of the gods.”"},{"Chapter":3,"Number":26,"Text":"Then Nebuchadnezzar went to the opening of the blazing furnace. He shouted, “Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, come out! Servants of the Most High God, come here!”So Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego came out of the fire."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":27,"Text":"When they came out, the princes, assistant governors, governors and royal advisers crowded around them. They saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies. Their hair was not burned. Their robes were not burned. And they didn’t even smell like smoke."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":28,"Text":"Then Nebuchadnezzar said, “Praise the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Their God has sent his angel and saved his servants from the fire! These three men trusted their God. They refused to obey my command. And they were willing to die rather than serve or worship any god other than their own."},{"Chapter":3,"Number":29,"Text":"So I now make this law: The people of any nation or language must not say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Anyone who does will be torn apart. And his house will be turned into a pile of stones. No other god can save his people like this.”"},{"Chapter":3,"Number":30,"Text":"Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the area of Babylon."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":1,"Text":"King Nebuchadnezzar sent a letter. It went to the people, nations and those who speak every language in all the world. The letter said:I wish you great wealth!"},{"Chapter":4,"Number":2,"Text":"The Most High God has done miracles and wonderful things for me.

But those men could not tell me what it meant."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":8,"Text":"Finally, Daniel came to me. (I called him Belteshazzar to honor my god. The spirit of the holy gods is in him.) I told my dream to Daniel."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":9,"Text":"I said, “Belteshazzar, you are the most important of all the fortune-tellers. I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you. I know there is no secret that is too hard for you to understand. This was what I dreamed. Tell me what it means."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":10,"Text":"These are the visions I saw while I was lying in my bed: I looked, and there in front of me was a tree. It was standing in the middle of the earth. The tree was very tall."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":11,"Text":"The tree grew large and strong. The top of the tree touched the sky. It could be seen from anywhere on earth."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":12,"Text":"The leaves of the tree were beautiful. It had plenty of good fruit on it. On the tree was food for everyone. The wild animals found shelter under the tree. And the birds lived in its branches. Every animal ate from it."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":13,"Text":"“I was looking at those things in the vision while lying on my bed. And then I saw a holy angel coming down from heaven."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":14,"Text":"He spoke very loudly. He said, ‘Cut down the tree, and cut off its branches. Strip off its leaves. Scatter its fruit around. Let the animals that are under the tree run away. Let the birds that were in its branches fly away."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":15,"Text":"But let the stump and its roots stay in the ground. Put a band of iron and bronze around it. Let it stay in the field with the grass around it.“‘Let the man become wet with dew. Let him live among the animals and plants of the earth."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":16,"Text":"Let him not think like a man any longer. Let him have the mind of an animal for seven years."},{"Chapter":4,"Number":17,"Text":"“‘Messengers gave this command. The holy ones declared the sentence. This is so all the people may know that the Most High God rules over the kingdoms of men. God gives those kingdoms to anyone he wants.

None of the wise men in my kingdom can explain it to me. But you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.” "},{"Chapter":4,"Number":19,"Text":"Then Daniel (also called Belteshazzar) was very quiet for a while. His thoughts made him afraid. So the king said, “Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its meaning make you afraid.”Then Daniel, called Belteshazzar, answered the king. He said, “My master, I wish the dream were about your enemies. And I wish its meaning were for those who are against you!"},{"Chapter":4,"Number":20,"Text":"You saw a tree in your dream.
