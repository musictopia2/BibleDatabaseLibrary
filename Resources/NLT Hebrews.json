He remains a priest forever, resembling the Son of God."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":4,"Text":"Consider then how great this Melchizedek was. Even Abraham, the great patriarch of Israel, recognized this by giving him a tenth of what he had taken in battle."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":5,"Text":"Now the law of Moses required that the priests, who are descendants of Levi, must collect a tithe from the rest of the people of Israel, who are also descendants of Abraham."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":6,"Text":"But Melchizedek, who was not a descendant of Levi, collected a tenth from Abraham. And Melchizedek placed a blessing upon Abraham, the one who had already received the promises of God."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":7,"Text":"And without question, the person who has the power to give a blessing is greater than the one who is blessed."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":8,"Text":"The priests who collect tithes are men who die, so Melchizedek is greater than they are, because we are told that he lives on."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":9,"Text":"In addition, we might even say that these Levites—the ones who collect the tithe—paid a tithe to Melchizedek when their ancestor Abraham paid a tithe to him."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":10,"Text":"For although Levi wasn’t born yet, the seed from which he came was in Abraham’s body when Melchizedek collected the tithe from him."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":11,"Text":"So if the priesthood of Levi, on which the law was based, could have achieved the perfection God intended, why did God need to establish a different priesthood, with a priest in the order of Melchizedek instead of the order of Levi and Aaron?"},{"Chapter":7,"Number":12,"Text":"And if the priesthood is changed, the law must also be changed to permit it."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":13,"Text":"For the priest we are talking about belongs to a different tribe, whose members have never served at the altar as priests."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":14,"Text":"What I mean is, our Lord came from the tribe of Judah, and Moses never mentioned priests coming from that tribe.

He lives forever to intercede with God on their behalf."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":26,"Text":"He is the kind of high priest we need because he is holy and blameless, unstained by sin. He has been set apart from sinners and has been given the highest place of honor in heaven."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":27,"Text":"Unlike those other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices every day. They did this for their own sins first and then for the sins of the people. But Jesus did this once for all when he offered himself as the sacrifice for the people’s sins."},{"Chapter":7,"Number":28,"Text":"The law appointed high priests who were limited by human weakness. But after the law was given, God appointed his Son with an oath, and his Son has been made the perfect High Priest forever."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":1,"Text":"Here is the main point: We have a High Priest who sat down in the place of honor beside the throne of the majestic God in heaven."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":2,"Text":"There he ministers in the heavenly Tabernacle, the true place of worship that was built by the Lord and not by human hands."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":3,"Text":"And since every high priest is required to offer gifts and sacrifices, our High Priest must make an offering, too."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":4,"Text":"If he were here on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there already are priests who offer the gifts required by the law."},{"Chapter":8,"Number":5,"Text":"They serve in a system of worship that is only a copy, a shadow of the real one in heaven.

Inside the Ark were a gold jar containing manna, Aaron’s staff that sprouted leaves, and the stone tablets of the covenant."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":5,"Text":"Above the Ark were the cherubim of divine glory, whose wings stretched out over the Ark’s cover, the place of atonement. But we cannot explain these things in detail now."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":6,"Text":"When these things were all in place, the priests regularly entered the first room as they performed their religious duties."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":7,"Text":"But only the high priest ever entered the Most Holy Place, and only once a year. And he always offered blood for his own sins and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":8,"Text":"By these regulations the Holy Spirit revealed that the entrance to the Most Holy Place was not freely open as long as the Tabernacle and the system it represented were still in use."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":9,"Text":"This is an illustration pointing to the present time. For the gifts and sacrifices that the priests offer are not able to cleanse the consciences of the people who bring them."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":10,"Text":"For that old system deals only with food and drink and various cleansing ceremonies—physical regulations that were in effect only until a better system could be established.

He has entered that greater, more perfect Tabernacle in heaven, which was not made by human hands and is not part of this created world."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":12,"Text":"With his own blood—not the blood of goats and calves—he entered the Most Holy Place once for all time and secured our redemption forever."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":13,"Text":"Under the old system, the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer could cleanse people’s bodies from ceremonial impurity."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":14,"Text":"Just think how much more the blood of Christ will purify our consciences from sinful deeds so that we can worship the living God. For by the power of the eternal Spirit, Christ offered himself to God as a perfect sacrifice for our sins."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":15,"Text":"That is why he is the one who mediates a new covenant between God and people, so that all who are called can receive the eternal inheritance God has promised them. For Christ died to set them free from the penalty of the sins they had committed under that first covenant."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":16,"Text":"Now when someone leaves a will, it is necessary to prove that the person who made it is dead."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":17,"Text":"The will goes into effect only after the person’s death. While the person who made it is still alive, the will cannot be put into effect."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":18,"Text":"That is why even the first covenant was put into effect with the blood of an animal."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":19,"Text":"For after Moses had read each of God’s commandments to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, along with water, and sprinkled both the book of God’s law and all the people, using hyssop branches and scarlet wool."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":20,"Text":"Then he said, “This blood confirms the covenant God has made with you.”"},{"Chapter":9,"Number":21,"Text":"And in the same way, he sprinkled blood on the Tabernacle and on everything used for worship."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":22,"Text":"In fact, according to the law of Moses, nearly everything was purified with blood. For without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":23,"Text":"That is why the Tabernacle and everything in it, which were copies of things in heaven, had to be purified by the blood of animals. But the real things in heaven had to be purified with far better sacrifices than the blood of animals."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":24,"Text":"For Christ did not enter into a holy place made with human hands, which was only a copy of the true one in heaven. He entered into heaven itself to appear now before God on our behalf."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":25,"Text":"And he did not enter heaven to offer himself again and again, like the high priest here on earth who enters the Most Holy Place year after year with the blood of an animal."},{"Chapter":9,"Number":26,"Text":"If that had been necessary, Christ would have had to die again and again, ever since the world began.
